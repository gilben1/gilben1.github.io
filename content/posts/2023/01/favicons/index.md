Tiny barely-a-post today, was using a hacked together in MS Paint Favicon, decided to spruce up the effort *ever* so slightly, so went with a generated one through [https://favicon.io/](https://favicon.io/). I used the Text -> ICO generator with the Monoton font and my initials. It looks maybe less good in the tiny browser version but it's neat enough for now.

It looks better blown up so I may keep it in some degree within the blog itself (maybe a header? or cover for posts?), but will probably adjust it to a single character or an easier to read font at actual favicon scale.
