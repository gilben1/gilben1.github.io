### New Blog, New Day

Well, that was easy. Turns out there's loads of frameworks for setting up a blog sort of thing without too much pain. 

Definitely easier and more maintainable than my last github pages site made in Elm, which made the simplest of tasks fantastically difficult. That site acted as an experiment in functional web development, but I didn't get too far. I did get it to reach out to the github repository and pull issues programatically, which was neat. The header image was pulled straight from my linkedin as well which was also cool.

This first post is more of a "Hello, world" than an actual blog post. I'm sure I'll post some actual ramblings about various Powershell shenangians I get up to at work.

Thanks for visiting this site in the meantime.
