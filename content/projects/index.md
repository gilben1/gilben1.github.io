## A bunch of stuff I've worked on
Lots of it is old and for archival purposes, but they're fun. 

Vaguely ordered with most recent first.

### Elm Site
This site used to be in [elm](https://elm-lang.org/), but I got tired of maintaining it, so I switched to [*Hugo*](https://gohugo.io/) using the [*PaperMod*](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme instead to act as a blog as well as a portfolio.

The site used Elm and Elm-Bootstrap to make something expandable.

I stopped using it because it became too much of a pain to update after not touching Elm for a while. The time it took to get back up to speed on what was planned was too much of a hassle to use long term.

It did look nice though.

Below are some screenshots of what the site looked like:

### "Haspall" Discord Bots

### Capstone Project: ROBOTIS-OP3

Written primarily in C++ on the backend with a Javascript web interface.

Code was split across multiple existing repositories.

### Various IRC Bots
Some (mostly useless) IRC bots that perform various functions. Dicebot let you roll dice in various fun ways, dad bot told dad jokes, ythaikubot pulled data from the subreddit [YoutubeHaiku](https://old.reddit.com/r/YoutubeHaiku), and parens-bot fixes those pesky loose parentheses.

Written in Bash because I hated myself when I wrote these. Mostly experimentation to get used to doing things in Bash.
